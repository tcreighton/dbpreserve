dbpreserve
==========

This repository is for a project to create tools to support digital preservation of databases.

It was initially created by Tom Creighton in partial fulfillment of the requirements
of Simmons College LIS-500.  This course was taken spring term (January - April)
2013.  It was a directed study class supervised by Dr. Ross Harvey, and was
part of the Digital Stewardship Certificate program at the college.

The initial goal is to create a utility that will enable an archivist to 
extract both data and metadata from a relational database in order to enable
preservation of the database.  The project was initially just scoped to the 
extraction process.  But the intent is to extend it to the point of formatting
the extracted data in a way that will support preservation actions, and that
can readily be read and transformed into some other database system.
